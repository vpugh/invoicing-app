I've followed this tutorial, relying heavily on the [github page](https://github.com/christiannwamba/invoicing-app) for the pieces that aren't explained thoroughly in the tutorials.

I've taken some liberaties with some parts of this app, mostly things relating to the look and some interaction related things.
